# Obsidian Habit Tracker

The script comes from this Tread: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/building-a-powerful-habit-tracker-in-obsidian-a-complete-guide/92884 and the user shanetimmons. 

How to install and use it here is a YT-Video (using the version in the thread): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsMefeIQ2d4

In words:
- Install the BRAT Plugin (this is a plugin for installing external (mostly beta) Plugins, which are not in the Obisidan Plugin Store).
- In the BRAT Plugin install the Datacore Plugin. Currently this is the Link you have to paste in: https://github.com/blacksmithgu/datacore
    - Datacore will probably replace Dataview in the long run. But is currently in Beta, although it already runs pretty reliable.
- Than create new empty file. And copy & paste the content of "obsidian_habit_tracker.md" into this file.
- Adjust the first 10-20 Lines to your needs. There are comments on how to alter them.
- Enjoy
